            There's a reason we call them man's best friend. We can learn so
            many things from a dog's behavior, personality, demeanor,
            resiliency, and most importantly, the willingness to provide their
            family members with unconditional love, loyalty, and companionship
            down to their very last breath.

          <p>
            Dobermans are compactly built dogs—muscular, fast, and
            powerful—standing between 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder. The body
            is sleek but substantial, and is covered with a glistening coat of
            black, blue, red, or fawn, with rust markings. These elegant
            qualities, combined with a noble wedge-shaped head and an easy,
            athletic way of moving, have earned Dobermans a reputation as
            royalty in the canine kingdom. A well-conditioned Doberman on patrol
            will deter all but the most foolish intruder.

          <P
            >Pugs often are described as a lot of dog in a small space. These
            sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club’s Toy
            group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they
            have a great sense of humor and like to show off. Originally bred to
            be a lap dog, the Pug thrives on human companionship. The Pug's
            comical face, with deep wrinkles around big, dark eyes and a flat
            round face, can't help but make you smile. It is believed that the
            Pug's name comes from the Latin word for "fist" because his face
            resembles a human fist. Pugs are clowns at heart, but they carry
            themselves with dignity. Pugs are playful dogs, ready and able for
            games, but they are also lovers, and must be close to their humans.
            Pugs love to be the center of attention, and are heartsick if
            ignored.

            The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate.
            Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they
            tend to get along well with other pets and strangers. These dogs are
            eager to please, which probably explains why they respond so well to
            obedience training and are such popular service dogs. They also like
            to work, whether it involves hunting birds or fetching their
            guardian's slippers.. Golden retrievers are not often barkers, and
            they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make good
            watchdogs. However, some golden retrievers will let you know when
            strangers are approaching.

            Dalmatians are highly energetic, playful and sensitive dogs. They
            are loyal to their family and good with children, although some
            Dalmatian experts caution that the breed may be too energetic for
            very small children. These dogs are intelligent, can be well trained
            and make good watchdogs. Some Dalmatians can be reserved with
            strangers and aggressive toward other dogs; others are timid if they
            are not well socialized, and yet others can be high-strung. These
            dogs are known for having especially good "memories" and are said to
            recall any mistreatment for years.

            sweet. With their short muzzles, shih tzu are not big chewers, but
            they do enjoy digging and some indulge in nuisance barking. They
            have a big desire to be with people, whether that is sitting on your

            Key Beagle personality traits are loving, curious, and friendly. It
            is very uncommon for a Beagle’s personality to be aggressive or
            violent. However, they have a boisterous voice and are known for
            their deep howls. A good way to combat difficult behavior is by
            making sure your Beagle is getting enough physical activity and
            attention. Along with their deep howls, they are known for having
            “musical voices.” They tend to “sing” along to any loud outside
            noises such as sirens or people passing by their house.

          <p>
            The Philippines’ native dogs are a mixture of different breeds, but
            it’s not clear what their real ancestors are. Aspins, however, have
            characteristics that distinctively identify them. Most Aspins are
            medium-sized dogs that stand at no more than two feet in height.
            Their coat is usually short and rough with varying colors. They can
            be brown, black, white, brindled or spotted. What’s great about
            Aspins is that they are lovable, resilient, and low-maintenance.
            They are more resistant to diseases, shed less fur, and are also
            good companions to children.
